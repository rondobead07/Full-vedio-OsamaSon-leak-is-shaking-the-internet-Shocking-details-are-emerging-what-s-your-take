Full vedio OsamaSon leak is shaking the internet! Shocking details are emerging what's your take
We hop out in Carroll Gardens, on a sunny street packed with parents pushing strollers. Inside a colorful soda fountain, decked out with retrobait diner-counter stools and garish showtunes blasting, we go dumbo: two cookies & cream milkshakes, a coke, hot chocolate dripping in s’mores ingredients, and a warm brownie sundae. OsamaSon got no sleep yesterday because of construction buzzing outside his hotel, so he really needed the sugar high.

crack the Billboard Top 200. He surprise-dropped it early after the entire project was leaked in late January. The album is so intricate it feels like getting lost in the datacombs, every track a cave system of layered effects and mutant melodies.

the young, rabid fans at his shows shake like they’re being electro-shocked. OsamaSon tells me his health insurance provider said they wouldn’t cover him if he kept stage diving.

OsamaSon grew up in Goose Creek, South Carolina, surrounded by musicians, so many that I can’t keep up—uncles who made hip-hop and R&B before their club burned down, older brothers who rapped. He started rapping in eighth grade to make funny songs for his classmates, and was always the center of attention in ways both positive and punitive; his school antics landed him a perma-slot in inner-school suspension, which meant he couldn’t leave the classroom all day… he was also expelled during middle school.

mesmerizing flow-state. As a former producer, he has a real knack for the interior decoration of a beat—little glitches here, ribbons of ad-lib there. He grinds until he has a gem; the onomatopoeia freakout “Waffle House” came from a 10-song marathon session while he was on tour in Prague.

Compared to his more aloof and edgy peers, there’s a welcome openness to the way OsamaSon divulges his foibles, like he’s content to be perceived as a goofy, honest striver. He talks for extended length about his love for “100 Days in Survival Mode” Minecraft videos and his contempt for the act of walking. “I’m super lazy, bro,” he confesses, blotting a strand of hair after it fell in his milkshake. “I hate walking around and shit. My brothers and shit, they like taking walks and shit. I don’t fuck with that shit, bro.”

What actually concerns him are the bananas theories people spread about him. Obsessive fans have concocted some lore he approves of, like calling him the “Goose Creek Demon.” But shitpost pages have also spammed fake info to the point where he’s had to alert his mom and dad to ignore it. “They build false narratives because they know certain names are gonna get them clicks and interactions—it affects us and our personal lives,” he groans. “[But] I am quite grateful for even being in a position where people can use my name for clout.”
